## What are the steps you took to approach this assignment?
-So the first step i took for this project was to gain a basic  understanding about the functionality and userflow from the provided files so i can start setting up the initial structure for the project.
-Then i started to create seperate files for different  user views.
-In this project i have implemented reactjs,vanilla css and localstorage for state management. 
-the app is structured by using pages and component folder
-Pages folder contains the set of views build with combination of a common component and a specific component which is only used in that view(if the component is small its directly coded).
-Component folder contains common components and a ui folder which holds small ui components(buttons etc..)
## How much time did you spend on each step?
The time spent on each step is quiet different as every step comes up with different challenges to deal with.
## What are some challenges you have in this assignment?
The challenge i faced was with the state management using localstorage as converting data to store and retrive was a bit repetitive  
## What are the steps that you decide not to do? What are the reason for it?
-I did not do the draggable category functionality as i don't have experience in implementing it as i need to study it and it would have needed more time.
-There is an category updation issue in the global space i.e the updated changes does not reflect.
## What are some TODO enhancement for this app?
-Improvement in the ui design, making it better for the desktop view. 
-State management(using a state management library)
-Code cleanup. 
-adding testing and validation
